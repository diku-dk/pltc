title: Research Groups
---

Research in PLTC is conducted by individual researchers, working in groups or
teams, perhaps joined with other research groups or individuals inside or
outside University of Copenhagen. In the PLTC section, we have identified
multiple research groups. Each individual researcher may or may not be part of
several groups.

## Decentralized Systems

We research and develop foundations, technology and applications of efficient
and secure networked/distributed computer systems controlled by multiple
independent principals.  This includes blockchain and distributed ledger
technology, event-driven architectures, large-scale transaction processing and
analytics (Big Data), streaming and real-time data processing, domain-specific
languages embodying domain knowledge and deep computer science techniques,
digital and smart contract technology, and more.  _(Fritz Henglein, Omri Ross)_

## Security & Privacy

We work primarily on software-based security and privacy preservation techniques
and applications. Emerging research topics are quantum cryptography and
compositional safety and security models for industrial systems.  _(Ken Friis
Larsen, Thomas Jensen, Andrzej Filinski)_

## HOT Lab

We design and develop theoretical and practical techniques for implementing and
analysing advanced Higher-Order and Typed programming languages. We maintain and
develop Moscow ML and MLKit, two Standard ML compilers, and conduct research
into the development of advanced optimisation techniques, including region-based
memory management, techniques for reactive web-development, and domain-specific
languages.  _(Martin Elsman, Ken Friis Larsen, Torben Mogensen)_

## Program Inversion and Reversible Computing

We study reversible computing with a focus on garbage-free computation models
and design of programming languages in these. Relations to other areas include
IT-security, computer systems, and quantum computation.  _(Robert Glück, Torben
Mogensen, Michael Kirkedal Thomsen)_

## Programming Language Theory and Technology

Our research covers theoretical and practical research of programming languages
with a focus on automatic program optimization, analysis and transformation.
_(Thomas Jensen, Fritz Henglein, Martin Elsman)_

## Data-Parallel Programming for Modern Architectures

We conduct language and compiler research, particularly with respect to using
functional techniques for generating efficient code for modern high-performance
architectures, including GPUs and multicore CPUs.  _(Troels Henriksen, Cosmin
E. Oancea, Martin Elsman, Ken Friis Larsen, Fritz Henglein)_

## Probabilistic Programming

In the the deep probabilistic programming group, the PLTC section hosts a team
of exceptional researchers who specialize in deep probabilistic
programming. This cutting-edge field combines the rigor of Bayesian statistics
with the versatility of deep learning to tackle a wide range of
applications. The group's research spans several areas, including the
development of new Bayesian inference techniques based on Stein variational
inference, as well as the application of high-performance computing methods
using the in-house developed FUTHARK language. We also investigate various
applications in bioinformatics, such as protein structure prediction, and work
with industry partners to develop AI-driven vaccine design and manufacturing
solutions. The group is actively involved in the advancement of two popular deep
probabilistic programming languages, Pyro and Numpyro. With our expertise and
resources, we aim to push the boundaries of this exciting field of probabilistic
machine learning and make valuable contributions to the scientific community.
_(Thomas Hamelryck, Fritz Henglein)_

## Financial Transparency

The Financial Transparency Group is an interdisciplinary research group that
promotes applied multidisciplinary research with industry partners addressing
computational challenges in the financial industries focused mainly on making
financial markets more transparent and inclusive.  _(Omri Ross)_

## Quantum Programming

The Quantum Programming Group studies the design and use of programming
languages in the context of quantum computing.  _(James Avery, Michael Kirkedal
Thomasen, Fritz Henglein, Thomas Jensen)_
