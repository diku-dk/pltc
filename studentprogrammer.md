## Looking for a student programmer

I (Troels Henriksen) am looking for a student programmer to work on
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org)-related code, with a particular
focus on building tools and infrastructure, including tasks such as:

* Creating a GitHub Actions runner so that we can run Github Actions
  on our own GPU-equipped machines.

* Creating an online REPL to make it easier to demonstrate the
  language.

* Possibly more as time and resources permit.

* Improving our tools for visualising and analysing performance
  measurements.

The position is not research- or compiler-related, and does not
require any experience with Futhark or any skill with functional or
parallel programming at all.  It does however require you to be a
somewhat capable programmer already - it is a job, not a learning
project.  I expect that most of the programming will be done with
common languages such as Python, Go, Elm, or Javascript.

The position is funded by [this DIREC
grant](https://direc.dk/ergonomic-practical-effect-systems/).  For
more information, or if you are interested in this position, write
Troels at athas@sigkill.dk

### Hours

Up to negotiation, but as the idea is that you are able to
concurrently study full time, perhaps 6-10 hours weekly.

### Salary

Surprisingly difficult to determine (may depend on whether you already
have a degree).  When I was a student programmer during my master's I
was paid about 170DKK/h (so less than you earn as a TA).
