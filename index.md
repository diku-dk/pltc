## Programming Languages and Theory of Computation

Welcome to the PLTC Section. We perform research in programming
language technology and in the theory of computation. Much of our work
involves topics in the intersection of programming language theory
(e.g., algorithmic aspects of programming and formal verification),
and applications (e.g., computer security and privacy, systems,
distributed ledger technology, and fintech).

### Research interests

We perform research in programming language technology (including ties
to program analysis, type systems and transformation, compiler and
language design, high-performance computing, and meta-programming),
and in the theory of computation (including ties to automata and
computability theory, logic, term rewriting and lambda calculus, and
reversible and quantum computing).

Much of our work involves topics in the intersection of programming
languages and theory (e.g., algorithmic aspects of programming and
formal verification), and applications (e.g., computer security and
privacy, systems, distributed ledger technology, and Fintech).

### Teaching

We offer courses for the bachelor and master's programmes in Computer
Science and Communication & IT. For the MSc programme, we suggest [the
study tracks in *Programming Language and
Systems*](https://studies.ku.dk/masters/computer-science/programme-structure/recommended_studytracks/).
