title: Programming Languages and Theory of Computation
---

Welcome to the PLTC Section. We perform research in programming
language technology and in the theory of computation. Much of our work
involves topics in the intersection of programming language theory
(e.g., algorithmic aspects of programming and formal verification),
and applications (e.g., computer security and privacy, systems,
distributed ledger technology, and Fintech).

## Location

The PLTC Section is located on the [ground floor of HCØ, in Building B](/images/office-plan.png),
Universitetsparken 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen.

## Research interests

We conduct research in programming language technology (including program
analysis, type systems, program transformation, compiler and language design,
high-performance computing, and meta-programming), and in the theory of
computation (including computability theory, logic, term rewriting and lambda
calculus, and reversible and quantum computing).

Much of our work involves topics in the intersection of programming languages
and theory (e.g., algorithmic aspects of programming and formal verification),
high-performance compiler technology for different architectures (e.g.,
data-parallel architectures, such as GPUs) and applications (e.g., computer
security and privacy, systems, distributed ledger technology, and Fintech).

See our brief descriptions of the [PLTC research groups](/pltc/groups).

## Teaching

We offer courses for the bachelor and master's programmes in Computer Science,
Computer Science and Economics, Machine-learning & Data-science, and
Communication & IT. For the MSc programme, we are primarily involved in [the study track in
*Programming Language and
Systems*](https://studies.ku.dk/masters/computer-science/programme-structure/recommended_studytracks/).

## Project supervision

PLTC researchers conduct project supervision spanning both BSc level and MSc
level supervision and spanning all kinds of projects, including thesis projects, POCS
(project out of course scope), PREP (thesis preparation project), and projects
involving external institutions or companies (for such projects it is in general
assumed that students them selves come with collaboration ideas).

project supervisor, you may also want to read the descriptions of the [PLTC research sections](/pltc/groups).

## Detailed suggestions for bachelors projects, masters projects, or POCS

### Futhark-related projects

[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org) is a research language developed
by various PLTC researchers.  See [this curated list of GitHub
issues](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astudent-viable)
for suggestions on projects related to working on the compiler itself.
Contact [Troels Henriksen](https://sigkill.dk), [Cosmin
Oancea](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~zgh600/), or [Martin
Elsman](https://elsman.com/) if you wish to work on one of these.

### Troels-related projects
